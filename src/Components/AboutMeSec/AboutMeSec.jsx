              . I'm a Passionate Front-end Web Developer expertise with MERN
              stack technologies based in Pabna, Bangladesh. My journey into
              programming began in June 2024, driven by a deep curiosity about
              how websites and applications work. At first, everything felt
              overwhelming variables, loops, and functions seemed like a foreign
              language. But with dedication and countless hours of practice, I
              gradually unlocked the logic behind coding.

              Over time, I found my passion in frontend development, where
              creativity meets functionality. Learning React, Tailwind CSS, and
              JavaScript, I built my first projects, each one improving my
              skills and confidence. As I delved deeper, I explored the MERN
              stack, expanding my knowledge with Node.js, Express.js, and
              MongoDB, which allowed me to develop dynamic and interactive web
              applications.

              But my learning never stops. Right now, I'm diving into Three.js
              to bring 3D elements to the web, Next.js for optimized and
              scalable applications, and Python to broaden my problem-solving
              abilities. Every day, I push myself to learn, experiment, and
              create something new. Beyond coding, I have a passion for movies
              and love immersing myself in different stories and genres. Iâ€™m
              also an avid traveler, always eager to explore new places,
              experience different cultures, and gain fresh perspectives. What
              started as a simple interest has now become a passion, and I'm
              excited to see where this journey takes me next! ðŸš€
